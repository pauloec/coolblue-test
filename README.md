Hello! My name is Paulo and this is my assignment to work with you guys! :)

## How to run

* Download or clone the repo
* Open `Coolblue.xcworkspace` file
* Hopefully if you press **Run** it will work
*  *Sigh a little if it doesn't...*
* Open your terminal and try `Pod Install`
* Now we should be A-Okay!

## Architecture

* Swift / UIKit (Sorry, no SwiftUI this time..)
* MVVM-C
* Modularity above all else!
